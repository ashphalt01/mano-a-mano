Mano-a-Mano is a sword-fighting game inspired by the likes of NIDHOGG and EGGNOGG, and was made so that I could explore 2D rendering and platformer game
mechanics.

////////////// CONTROLS \\\\\\\\\\\\\\
PLAYER A:				PLAYER B:
W - position sword upwards		I - position sword upwards
S - position sword downwards		K - position sword downwards
A - move left				J - move left
D - move right				L - move right
V - jump				ENTER - jump
B and A/D - initiate a lunge		RSHIFT and J/L - initiate a lunge

The point of your sword will kill the opposite player on contact.
If swords are oriented the same way however, a block will occur and players are knocked back. Using this, lunges can be blocked.
A lunge sends a player forward in the direction of movement while extending the range of the sword momentarily. Has a cooldown. 
Use lunges to try and score a quick kill, or to take advantage of the opposite player's wasted lunge. Or, use lunges in midair.
